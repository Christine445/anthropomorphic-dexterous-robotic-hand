# anthropomorphic-hand
This repo contains design files for fusion 360 as well as a description how to set up the robotic hand (prototype1 & 2).

## Prototype 1
The Prototype 1 was developed independently from Roboy. The goal was to build a tendon driven anthropomorphic robotic hand, which is able to closely mimic the human hand. Because of the inherent complexity of a real human hand, biomimetic anthropomorphic hands inevitably involve lots of compromises to get them to work properly while maintaining a human-ish form factor.

## Prototype 2
The Prototype 2 will be develop to adapt it onto Roboy 2.0. The servo motors will be placed on Roboy´s arm (Documentation: https://devanthro.atlassian.net/wiki/display/R2M/Arms). The design of Roboy´s hand will be more humanlike and a additional wrist was developed. We developed a new Tendon routing which will solve the issues of precision. Furthermore, a angle measurement on the wrist will be implemented to control the tendons on the wrist much easiser.
