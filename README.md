# anthropomorphic-hand
This repo contains design files for fusion 360 as well as a description how to set up the robotic hand (prototype1 & 2).

The human hand has a very delicate and complex structure. This allows muscles and joints in the hand a great range of movement and precision. The goal of this work is to build a tendon driven anthropomorphic robotic hand, which is able to closely mimic the human hand. Because of the inherent complexity of human hand, biomimetic anthropomorphic hand inevitably involves lots of compromises while maintaining a human-ish form factor. The hand for Roboy is designed based on the general idea of Roboy, whose limbs are all driven with motors using tendons. Due to the complexity of the human hand, lots of simplifications (like reducing the degree of freedom and integrated mechanical joints) are required.

## Current challenges & scope for the future work:
The prototype 1 was only a test prototype for Roboy and the prototype 2 is more compact with a better design in comparison to the prototype 1.
To make the robotic hand adaptable to the Roboy 2.0 hand-arm system and being preciser, the following points will be considered: 
The design should look more human like. 
The new tendon routing should help to increase the precision of the fingers. 
Since the space for the motors is limited, the new robotic hand should have a resonable degree of fredom. 
A mathematical model to simulate the tendon driven hand.
Another servo motor (with more power) has to be selected to increase the gripping force of the hand. 
To control the wrist a sensor system is necessary (sensor angle measurement).

### Prototype 1
The prototype 1 was developed independently from Roboy to test the hand with the servo system driven by 25 motors and the design of five tendon driven fingers.

### Prototype 2
The prototype 2 is being developed (June 2017) with the whole Roboy team so that it can be adapted into Roboy 2.0. The prototype 2 has 20 servo motors which will be integrated in Roboy´s new arm (Documentation: https://devanthro.atlassian.net/wiki/display/R2M/Arms). The new design of Roboy´s hand will be more humanlike and a wrist will also be developed. The new tendon routing is improving the precision from the old robotic hand. Furthermore, a sensor system on the wrist will be implemented.
